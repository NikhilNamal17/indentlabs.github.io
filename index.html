          About
        </h3>
        <p>
          Indent Labs is, at its core, an ambitious open-source natural language processing
          project aimed squarely at moonshots in the field of writing. Wouldn't it be awesome
          if you could generate high-quality stories from outlines? Automatically outline your
          story? Generate a story as you make decisions on behalf of a character? What about
          pointing out logical inconsistencies you missed in writing, and suggesting solutions?
        </p>
        <p>
          The first word processor showed up in the 60s and revolutionized writing through
          technology. Isn't it time for another shift forward?
        </p>
